# Polish checklist (Day 6)

- Smooth scroll: flavor CTAs scroll to the shop anchor; verify on desktop/mobile.
- Micro-interactions: nav links, CTAs, toggle, cart button, flavor cards, and hero stat cards lift subtly on hover/focus.
- Contrast: text on gradients uses dark slate; CTA focus rings use amber; gradients avoid hard banding on mobile widths.
- Responsiveness: flavor row collapses to 2x2 on tablet and stacked on mobile; testimonial and community strips wrap without overflow.
- Alt text: all homepage images (flavor cards, story images, community tiles) include descriptive `alt`; uses image keys for future CMS swap.
- Keyboard: mobile nav/toggle and cart CTA have focus-visible states; flavor cards focus via CTA; ribbon/nav keep outline.
- Performance: Unsplash URLs capped with width params; rely on browser resizing; placeholders available for missing keys.
- Follow-ups: revisit other pages (shop/product/cart/blog) to align with new gradients/shadows and QA contrasts once homepage settles.
